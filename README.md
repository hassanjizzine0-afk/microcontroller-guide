# microcontroller-guide
Welcome to the Microcontroller repository. This project serves as a comprehensive guide and documentation hub for various microcontroller architectures. Here, I explore and explain the technical specifications, pinouts, and use cases for popular types, including 8-bit (8051, AVR), 16-bit (MSP430), and 32-bit (ARM Cortex, ESP32) systems.
